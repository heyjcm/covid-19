# COVID-19 Analysis

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

As of this writing (21 June 2020, two months later), it is clear that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data. The will be published on a ~weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.
