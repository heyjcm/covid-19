# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-08-31

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

<b>US State Graphs Analysis</b>

When I was creating this week's plots, something odd came up. I didn't notice it at first, but as I cycled quickly through each of the individual states' plot, it became apparent. I noticed a pattern with just about half of the states wherein a week or two after a certain date, specifically 14 July, confirmed cases started to drop. I've added a vertical dotted line to each of the individual state graphs to show where 14 July is.

Looking back at headlines for that day, you can find that this is when the Trump Administration ordered hospitals to bypass reporting daily patient information to the CDC and report directly to a central database operated by the Department of Health and Human Services (https://www.foxnews.com/us/hospital-coronavirus-data-cdc-trump-washington-dc-health-human-services).

I made a table of those states where this pattern fits and one where the pattern does not exist. I then also looked at the 2016 Presidential Election results and discovered that of the states that fit the pattern, the overwhelming majority (20 out of 26, or 77%) had voted for Trump while only 6 out of 26 (23%) voted for Trump.

Of those states that did not fit the pattern, 10 out of 25 (40%) voted for Trump and 15 out of 25 (60%) did not vote for Trump (i.e. this is more evenly split).

Of course it's true that correlation does not equal causation, but it certainly is a strange pattern to come up in the data.

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20200831

Please let me know if you have any requests!
