# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-07-26

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

<b>Facebook Post This Week</b>

Yes, I know I'm late again, but we went camping this past weekend so I have an excuse. However, I did pull this data on Sunday, 26 July, so it's still consistent.

Looking at the US daily graph it seems that the spiking cases are now resulting in a steady increase in deaths. Based on the data, there seems to be about a 5 week lag from when there are increased confirmed cases to when deaths start to increase. You can see this by looking at the week between 4 and 11 June where confirmed cases per day in the US started going up and then looking at the deaths graph below it when, between 9 and 16 June shows the start of an increase in deaths.

This doesn't hold exactly for Florida and Texas where the rise in COVID cases resulted in a rise in deaths with only about a 2 to 3 week lag.

This is now my opinion, but the way our numbers are increasing, it seems we (at least in the US) will continue to operate the same way we have been for the last few months into at least Q2 of 2021.

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20200726

Please let me know if you have any requests!
