# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-11-29

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data in the US. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

<b>US State Graphs Analysis</b>

Last weekend (the weekend before Thanksgiving) was the most traveled since the pandemic started in March when air travel all but ground to a halt (ok, maybe "severely limited" is more appropriate). Either way, we won't see the effects of all that travel with respect to COVID cases until mid to late December so stay tuned!

Last week I stated that the deaths did not seem to be following the increased number of cases (i.e. the deaths due to COVID remained flat). Sadly, this is no longer the case this week as the spike in confirmed cases across the country is now starting to show an upward trend in deaths as well.

The good news is that the number of active cases has gone down by about 140,000 week-over-week to 652,458. It's yet to be determined how Thanksgiving will affect that right before Christmas.

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20201129

Please let me know if you have any requests!
