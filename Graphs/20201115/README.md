# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-11-15

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

The link to my main [COVID-19 repo is here](https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19).

<b>US State Graphs Analysis</b>

So it's been a while since I last posted. It started when we went on a 2-week road trip in mid-September to visit some of our favorite National Parks (looking at you, Redwood National Park!). Sorry about that!

Starting out slowly and getting back into the swing of things!

Things look to be heating up quite a bit in the US in terms of confirmed cases.

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20201115

Please let me know if you have any requests!

<b>US Daily Trends Analysis:</b>

US active cases Sunday, 15 Nov: 6,509,848<br>
US active cases 7 days before: 5,773,650<br>
US active cases delta (Sunday - 7 days ago): 736,198<br>
US active cases percent delta: +12.75% in 7 days

The US Daily Graphs is definitely showing that we've started a "third wave" of confirmed cases. The strange thing is that the deaths seem to be flat lined starting when the Trump administration mandated that hospital report COVID-19 data directly to it rather than to the CDC (15 July, https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/15/891351706/white-house-strips-cdc-of-data-collection-role-for-covid-19-hospitalizations). That date is shown on the US Daily plot as a vertical dotted line.
