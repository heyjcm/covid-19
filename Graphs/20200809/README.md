# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-08-09

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

<b>US State Graphs Analysis</b>

On 7 Aug, Sturgis (the large gathering in South Dakota of motorcycle enthusiasts) started. In recent years, the population of Sturgis, SD has grown by +500,000 during this week of the year. I've read reports saying that only about half that (250,000) are expected this year. Still, this is a huge number of people who will be in close quarters with each other. I'm interested to see what will happen in the coming weeks. However, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to track since those who may contract COVID at Sturgis may or may not alert Sturgis organizers about it. I'd really love for it to go "well" and not become the genesis of a super-spread site.

In other news, on 15 July, the Department of Health and Human Services ordered hospitals to bypass reporting COVID cases to the CDC. When looking at the graphs in states with alarmingly increasing confirmed cases (like AZ, CA, FL, SC, TX, and UT), it would appear that after that date, those rates seemed to have dropped significantly. In fact, the curve seem in those states seem to more or less match each other. Remember to tell yourself: correlation does not equal causation because it may be due to those states' governors' increased/renewed focus on mask laws (yes!).

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20200809

Please let me know if you have any requests!

<b>US Daily Trends Analysis:</b>

The US has 3,192,385 active cases as of as of 9 Aug, a net gain of 188,273 from 2 Aug which totaled 3,004,112 at that time -- a 6.3% increase in 7 days.

In the last 5 or so weeks, there has been a steady increase in the number of deaths in the US. This trails the confirmed cases curve by about 6 weeks which may explain the increase in deaths.

<b>Global Trends Analysis:</b>

Argentina, Germany, Japan, and the US are up; staying within the same range as last week are Italy, New Zealand, and Sweden; Chile, South Korea, and Italy are down. I read an article stating that New Zealand has been without a new COVID case for 100 days (https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-zealand-marks-100-straight-days-without-new-coronavirus-infection). Fantastic news! I wish we could be like New Zealand when we grow up!
