# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-08-16

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

<b>US State Graphs Analysis</b>

This weekend, we went camping in Wyoming in the Medicine Bow National Forest. I mention this because Annabelle and I stopped at a Safeway in Cheyenne to pick up some things we had forgotten. I was curious to see how Wyoming was doing in terms of COVID cases and deaths and, not surprisingly, the least populous state in the nation has very little confirmed cases and extremely low number of deaths. Despite the seemingly low probability of catching COVID and low number of deaths, it was great to see that most of the people in the store were adhering to wearing masks in public spaces (rough guess: 75% - 80%) and (sort of by default) social distancing throughout the part of the state that we saw.

In other news, states that once had an alarming spike in cases (e.g. AZ, CA, FL, GA, TX, NC, and others) are now starting to settle back down. This is likely explained by those states' governors re-tightening their policies around COVID. Here in Colorado, our governor did the same a little sooner than those states I previously mentioned and the same downward trend can be seen.

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20200816

Please let me know if you have any requests!

<b>US Daily Trends Analysis:</b>

US active cases today: 3,373,157<br>
US active cases last week: 3,192,385<br>
US active cases delta (today - last week): 180,772<br>
US active cases percent delta: +5.4% in 7 days

Looking at the US Daily graphs, it seems that the rise in confirmed cases a few weeks ago is now translating to a rise in deaths. However, the good news is that the confirmed cases has been going down in the past couple of weeks which should result in a lower death rate in a few weeks.

<b>Global Trends:</b>

Since last week:<br>
Countries whose active cases have increased: Germany, South Korea, Philippines, US.<br>
Countries whose active cases have remained about the same: Chile, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden.<br>
Countries whose active cases have decreased: Argentina.
