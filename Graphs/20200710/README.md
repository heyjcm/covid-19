# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-07-10

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

<b>Facebook Post This Week</b>

I'm publishing this a little early this week because, after 6 years of ownership, my Macbook battery has finally expanded enough for me to want to get it replaced. It's been expanding for a while, but it's legit wobbling pretty bad now so before this battery blows up in my face, I'm taking it to the shop for a couple of days.

But for this week, I added another new feature to include a visualization for hospitalizations in each of the state plots. Thanks for the idea, Jason! It took me less time than I initially told you :)

Florida is just going bonkers with confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths shooting up. It's no wonder things have re-closed!

Here's an interesting thing I discovered as I dug into the data this week: while states have been very consistent at reporting their confirmed cases and deaths attributed to COVID, the reporting for hospitalizations has not been consistent or uniform at all. Some states have been reporting their numbers regularly while others are spotty or not at all. So when you look at your state and if the hospitalizations look weird, you'll know why.

I haven't decided if I'm keeping this hospitalization visualization since I really don't want to report incomplete data; but that, in and of itself, is also information to be taken into consideration.

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20200710

Please let me know if you have any requests!

<b>Analysis:</b>

Colorado, my home state, is seeing an upward trend in confirmed cases, but maintaining a steady hospitalization rate and declining daily deaths. This is good news because, again, we're trying to flatten the curve for our hospitals. That's the whole point of this. In personal news, my COVID test came back negative!

The US has 2,015,545 active cases, a net gain of 200,110 from last Sunday's total of 1,815,435 -- a whopping 11% increase from less than a week's total active cases. By comparison, the net increase in active cases last week was 110,131. So in less than a week, the US has doubled its active cases. We're /#1? /#somuchwinning

In global trends:
Argentina, Japan, the Philippines, Sweden, and the US are up; staying within the same range as last week are Germany, South Korea, and New Zealand; Chile and Italy are down.
