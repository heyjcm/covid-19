# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-12-27

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data in the US. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

<b>US State Graphs Analysis</b>

First, let me say to all the people who celebrated a couple of days ago: Merry Christmas! Annabelle and I had a quiet Christmas this year. We did a few video calls with friends and family and took advantage of the 60ยบ weather on Christmas day to get outside our house, walk around our neighborhood, and enjoy the sun and warmth!

And to everyone, we wish you a Happy New Year and may the new year be filled with new hope and vaccinations for everyone!

This week, I added Brazil to the list of countries as promised to my friend Rafael. In addition, another request by my friend Lesley prompted a per-million graph of the country death and confirmed cases graph.

The confirmed cases graph looks like US is #1## (which we knew), but now I have a graph normalizing based on population. Deaths, on the other hand, makes the US not look so bad. It appears Italy and Argentina (from my small subset of chosen countries) are ahead.

As for US trends, we continue to climb in both confirmed cases and deaths; however, I'm happy to report that, at least in Colorado, confirmed cases started a downward trend starting at the beginning of December. Keep it up, Colorado!

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20201213

Please let me know if you have any requests!
