# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-12-07

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data in the US. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

The link to my main [COVID-19 repo is here](https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19).

<b>US State Graphs Analysis</b>

Let me first talk about the US daily graphs. They're not good. The COVID-19 Deaths per Day graph looks sort of like a smiley face, but there is nothing here to smile about. The number of deaths per day now exceed the daily deaths we saw back in the March/April timeframe. We don't have quite the volume yet, but this spike in COVID deaths started around mid-November. So that word "yet" may be portentous.

It's still too early to tell what will result in the amount of travelers during Thanksgiving since there is, typically speaking, a lag when a COVID case is reported and when that person dies from it. The time period between hospitalization to death may happen within days, but it can also take several weeks.

I hope that for the sake of the people you love around you, that you are doing all you can to keep yourself safe and keep those around you safe by wearing a mask, social distancing, and limiting your time around other people who are not in your immediate household or quarantine pod.

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20201207

Please let me know if you have any requests!
