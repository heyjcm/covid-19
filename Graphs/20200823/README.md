# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-08-23

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

The link to my main [COVID-19 repo is here](https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19).

<b>US State Graphs Analysis</b>

In general, many of the states that I have been closely keeping an eye on are bending their confirmed cases downward throughout the last couple of weeks. This is reflected in the US Daily graphs (as I discuss below). Wonderful news! Keep wearing your masks, people!!!

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20200823

Please let me know if you have any requests!

<b>US Daily Trends Analysis:</b>

US active cases today: 3,505,275<br>
US active cases last week: 3,373,157<br>
US active cases delta (today - last week): 132,118<br>
US active cases percent delta: +3.9a% in 7 days

Looking at the US Daily graphs, it seems cases are starting to trend downward and deaths seem to be plateauing. Hopefully this is good news and not the calm before the storm as we move into the Fall season.

<b>Global Trends:</b>

Since last week:<br>
Countries whose active cases have increased: Germany, Italy, South Korea, New Zealand, and the Philippines.<br>
Countries whose active cases have remained about the same: Argentina, Chile, Sweden, and the US.<br>
Countries whose active cases have decreased: Japan.
