# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-07-19

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

The link to my main [COVID-19 repo is here](https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19).

<b>Facebook Post This Week</b>

"Many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you canâ€™t socially distance." - Donald Trump https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1285299379746811915

The data is clear that in states where mask-wearing is encouraged or mandated, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths decrease; where mask-wearing is not culturally accepted, the opposite is true.

Also, my apologies, but I completely forgot to publish this on Sunday, the 19th like I normally would; however, these plots were pulled on the 19th so the data and numbers are consistent!

No new features this week since, as you know, my Macbook was out of commission for most of the week last week getting its battery replaced.

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20200719

Please let me know if you have any requests!

<b>Analysis:</b>

Florida, COVID-19's darling, continues to spike on all fronts: daily confirmed cases, daily hospitalizations, and daily deaths. Sprinting to beat Florida is California with similar surges in daily confirmed cases and increasing daily deaths. Both states have an "Orange County", but don't let that fool you into making spurious correlations (https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations).

The US has 2,448,574 active cases as of 19 July, a net gain of 433,029 from the last time I posted (Friday, 10 July) which totaled 2,015,545 at that time -- a 21% increase in 9 days. I was asked what the total delta of confirmed cases was between 12 to 19 July and it is a whopping increase of +527,335 between the two dates.

In global trends:
Argentina, Japan, the Philippines, Sweden, and the US are up; staying within the same range as last week are South Korea, and New Zealand; Chile, Germany, and Italy are down once again.
