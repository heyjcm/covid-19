# COVID-19 Analysis for 20200614

<b>Purpose</b>

The purpose of this project is to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there are any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr) and an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

<b>Analysis</b>
I heard that New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern stated that NZ is virus free! So I added NZ to the Countries graph to see what that looks like. Wow! Maybe some day the US will catch up.

Speaking of the US, we’ve more than doubled the number of active cases today (1,402,484) since 20 Apr (669,903) — about 7 weeks.

South Korea is on a surprising continuous increase after two months of decline. I was hoping it would come back down this week, but no dice.

In other countries: active cases continue to increase in Argentina, Chile, Philippines, Sweden, and the US – nothing new from last week.

Italy, Germany, and Japan all had continued decreases in active cases which has been the trend for several weeks.

For US states:
Confirmed cases continue to trend upward (in some states like AZ, upward like a mofo) in: AZ, CA, FL, GA, IA, and TX
Daily confirmed cases are trending down in CO, IL, MI, NY, VA, WI
Daily deaths increased in AZ, CA, FL, and GA
Deaths decreased in CO, IA, IL, MI, NY, TX, VA, and WI
