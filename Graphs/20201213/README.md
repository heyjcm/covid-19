# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-12-13

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data in the US. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

<b>US State Graphs Analysis</b>

This week's COVID news continues to be depressing as COVID daily deaths keep going up with two days this past week going above 3,000 deaths (the most since the pandemic began). During the first wave back in April/May, the max amount of daily deaths were just around ~2,600. It appears that the increased number of deaths are now catching up the increased number of cases (hovering just around ~225,000 confirmed cases per day).

Vaccines have now started to get distributed in both the UK and the US with plans to vaccinate 100 million people in the US by March (about 30% of the  population).

If I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20201213

Please let me know if you have any requests!
