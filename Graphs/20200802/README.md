# COVID-19 Analysis for 2020-08-02

<b>Purpose</b>

I started this project on 22 Apr 2020. The original purpose of this project was to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there were any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr, etc) with an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).

It is evident that states that opened early (e.g. TX, FL, AZ, AR, etc) have had a dramatic increase in confirmed cases with a very strong positive correlation to the date of reopening.

Now that this has been confirmed/substantiated, my new focus for this project will be to track and publish state confirmed and death data. The will be published on a weekly basis and kept in the Graphs folder of this repo.

<b>Facebook Post This Week</b>

Earlier this week, the company I work for closed out its Q2 (it lags by a month so we don't have to close Q4 on 31 Dec, which I appreciate). Around the same time, Reuters posted an article saying that economists had forecasted a 34.1% slump in US GDP in Q2. The good news is that it didn't slide that far. The bad news, is that US GDP still went down by 32.9%, the biggest decline in GDP since the US started keeping record in 1947.

Intuitively, one would expect that since restaurants aren't serving as many customers, people are staying in more, and summer travel (our busiest time of year for travel) is at an all time low. To add to that, Americans have been banned from traveling to many countries so even if you wanted to travel abroad, your US passport is worthless (https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandrasternlicht/2020/07/20/these-33-countries-have-banned-us-travelers/).

Again, if I didn't post your favorite state, just let me know because I have them all, I just don't post them all. Or you can go to the link to my repo here and find your state: https://github.com/heyjcm/covid-19/tree/master/Graphs/20200802

Please let me know if you have any requests!

<b>Analysis:</b>

The US has 3,004,112 active cases as of as of 2 Aug , a net gain of 555,538 from 19 July (the last time I posted on a Sunday) which totaled 2,448,574 at that time -- a 22.7% increase in 14 days.

In addition, since around the 2nd of July, the US has steadily increased its deaths week over week. This may be due to the ever-increasing confirmed cases starting around that time (with the wave of deaths lagging confirmed cases by around 5-6 weeks).

In global trends:
Argentina, Germany, Japan, and the US are up; staying within the same range as last week are Italy, South Korea, New Zealand, and Sweden; Chile and Italy are down.
