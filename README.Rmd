# COVID-19 Analysis

**Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to analyze the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and to see if there are any correlations between opening states early (e.g. Texas on 20 Apr) and an increased rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and subsequently, COVID-19 deaths).
